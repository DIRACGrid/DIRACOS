Test DIRACOS as a User
======================

If you want to test DIRACOS in a DIRAC installation, it is enough to do
the following:

::

     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/integration/Core/scripts/dirac-install.py
     chmod +x dirac-install.py
     ./dirac-install.py -r v6r20 --dirac-os --dirac-os-version=0.0.5
